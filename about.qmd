## 1 · Early Life & Education {.pt-2}

I grew up in Palos Verdes, California where the proximity to the ocean led me to UCSB. I will be graduating in 2026 with a B.S. in **Hydrologic Science and Policy** where I hope the future research that I conduct will be used to implement progressive water-based policies that improve the lives of people and the health of our environment.

## 2 · Current Research Focus {.pt-2}

> *As climate change continues to diminish the quality of natural land cover, understanding how elephant movement patterns evolve is crucial to implementing policy solutions that enhance ecological conservation and prevent human-wildlife conflict.*

Using **Sentinel-2 imagery, CHIRPS rainfall data, and Google Earth Engine**, I model ephemeral surface-water dynamics to predict future elephant movement under SSP climate scenarios.
Key skills & tools:

-   Remote sensing (GEE, `terra`, `raster`)\
-   GIS analysis
-   reproducible R / Python workflows

## 3 · Beyond Academics {.pt-2}

-   **DEI Coordinator, UCSB Hydrology Club** — developing outreach events that bring first-generation and historically excluded students into water-related careers.
- **Lifeguard** - my interest in hydrologic systems doesn't stop at science and policy; I've been lifeguarding since I was 15!
-   **Vegan recipe developer** — I've been writing a cookbook with all my favorite protein-rich, plant-forward recipes I've been perfecting over the years
-   **Athletics** — After a decade of playing water polo, I've dabbled in power lifting, jumping higher, surfing, basketball, spikeball, and everything in between. I'm motivated to break the myth that one needs meat to be strong.
