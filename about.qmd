## 1 · Early Life & Education  {.pt-2}

I’m a third-year undergraduate at **UC Santa Barbara** pursuing a B.S. in Hydrologic Science & Policy with a minor in Philosophy.  
My academic path blends physical science with critical thinking, driving me to ask *why* water systems matter to society.

## 2 · Research Focus  {.pt-2}

At the core of my work is the question:

> *How will elephants navigate an increasingly fragmented, drier landscape?*

Using **Sentinel-2 imagery, CHIRPS rainfall data, and Google Earth Engine**, I model ephemeral surface-water dynamics and feed these layers into circuit-theory corridors to predict future elephant movement under SSP climate scenarios.  
Key skills & tools:

- Remote sensing (GEE, `terra`, `raster`)  
- GIS network analysis  
- R / Python workflow automation

## 3 · Beyond the Lab  {.pt-2}

- **DEI Coordinator, UCSB Hydrology Club** — developing outreach events that bring first-generation and historically excluded students into water-science careers.  
- **Plant-based recipe developer** — writing a cookbook that pairs global flavors with local produce.  
- **Ocean enthusiast** — if the waves permit, you’ll find me open-water swimming at dawn.
